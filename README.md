# Uncompiled Bootstrap

Uncompiled `*.less` files of [Twitter Bootstrap] with all needed images and javascript plugins attached to use with, for example, [Sinatra AssetPack], allowing you to modify the base variables and choose which parts to use before compiling to css on push. It may grow in the future versions in gem, or may not.

## Version

Currently it's based on v2.3.2 tag of Bootstrap.
